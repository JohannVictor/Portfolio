            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h3>From Insurance Pro to Creative Coder: Exploring the World of Web Development</h3>
            <h4>Introduction:</h4>
            <p>
                My journey into web development started with a friend's request to build a website using Wix. Intrigued
                by the process, I soon discovered a deeper fascination with crafting web experiences. Seeing my friend,
                a talented web developer, fueled my passion even further. I wanted to understand the magic behind those
                user-friendly interfaces and visually appealing layouts.
            </p>
            <h4>Skills and Interests:</h4>
            <p>
                Drawn to the visual aspects of web development, I'm currently immersing myself in the world of front-end
                technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I find it incredibly satisfying to see my code come to life
                as interactive and visually engaging elements.

                While new to coding, I bring over 15 years of experience from the insurance industry, honing skills like
                problem-solving, communication, attention to detail, and teamwork. These skills perfectly complement my
                approach to learning and collaborating.
            </p>
            <h4>Journey and Goals:</h4>
            <p>
                I'm currently learning through platforms like Codecademy, enjoying the challenges and breakthroughs that
                come with every new concept mastered. My short-term goal is to land a junior web developer position,
                eager to contribute my skills and learn from experienced professionals. My long-term dream is to follow
                in my friend's footsteps and eventually become a leader in the field, guiding and mentoring others.
            </p>
            <h4>Call to Action:</h4>
            <p>
                I'm excited to see where this journey takes me, and I'm always open to connecting with other passionate
                developers or learning opportunities. Feel free to explore my portfolio to see my progress and get a
                glimpse into my creative vision.
            </p>
